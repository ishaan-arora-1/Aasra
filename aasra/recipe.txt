This recipe uses milk to make a simple yogurt if you don't already have some.  If you *do* have yogurt, skip steps 1-3.

**Yields:** 2 servings
**Prep time:** 10 minutes
**Chill time:** (optional) 30 minutes


**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup milk (whole milk is best, but any will do)
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice or white vinegar
* 1/2 cup mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
* 1/2 cup chopped melon (cantaloupe or honeydew)
* 1/4 cup grapes, halved
* 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional, to taste)


**Instructions:**

1. **Make Yogurt (if needed):** In a jar or bowl, combine the milk and lemon juice/vinegar. Stir gently. Cover and let stand at room temperature for at least 8 hours or overnight.  The milk will curdle, creating a simple yogurt.  This won't be as thick as store-bought yogurt.

2. **Strain (optional):** For a thicker yogurt, line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and pour the curdled milk into it. Let it drain in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.

3. **Combine:** Gently stir the yogurt (store-bought or homemade) and add honey or maple syrup if desired.

4. **Add Fruit:** Add the berries, melon, and grapes to the yogurt. Gently toss to combine.

5. **Chill (optional):** For best flavor, cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving.
